# Netcap Tensorflow Deep Neural Network

This repository contains a python implementation for using a Deep Neural Network with [Keras](https://keras.io) and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org),
that operates on CSV data produced by the [netcap](github.com/dreadl0ck/netcap) framework.

It is based on the implementation demonstrated by Prof Jeff Heaton's Washington University (in St. Louis) Course T81-558: Applications of Deep Neural Networks,
that has been adapted and parameterized in order to offer flexibility for experiments.

This project was created for my bachelor thesis *"Implementation and evaluation of secure and scalable anomaly-based network intrusion detection"*,
to conduct a series of experiments on identifying malicious behavior in the [CIC-IDS-2017](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html) dataset.
The thesis and presentation slides are available on [researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Anomaly-based-Network-Security-Monitoring).
Each experiment is executed with a dedicated shell script.
